## Project Steps

1. Import pizza sales data into SQL Server; ensure column data types and integrity.
2. Write SQL queries for KPIs, order trends, and product breakouts as defined by the problem statement.
3. Validate SQL results, export for use in Power BI or connect directly for live data.
4. Clean/process data in Power BI as required (Power Query, calculated columns/measures).
5. Design dashboards per requirements: KPIs, trends, distributions, and product analysis.
6. Implement drill-through, dynamic filtering, and navigation for maximum usability.

## Insights Gained

- Peak sales occur on weekends, especially Fridays.
- Large pizzas and Classic/Supreme categories are most ordered.
- Seasonal dips detected in September; consider targeted promotions.
- Best sellers identified for potential upselling; underperformers for menu optimization.
