### Pizza_Sales_Analysis

### Project Overview

This project involved the development of an interactive Pizza Sales Dashboard to analyze business performance using real sales data. The aim was to provide management with actionable insights about key sales metrics, ordering trends, product performance, and customer preferences.

### Objectives

- Track overall business performance using relevant KPIs:
  - Total Revenue
  - Average Order Value
  - Total Pizzas Sold
  - Total Orders
  - Average Pizzas Per Order

- Visualize trends and breakdowns to highlight sales hot spots, product popularity, and inventory optimization opportunities.

### Data Preparation

- Imported cleaned pizza sales data containing order details (date, pizza type/category/size, quantity, price, etc.).
- Processed and aggregated key fields for accurate KPI calculation and trend analyses.

### Dashboard Implementation

#### KPI Cards
- Summarized vital business statistics at a glance, including total revenue, order value, pizzas sold, order count, and average pizza count per order.

#### Trend Charts
- **Daily Trend for Total Orders:**  
  Bar chart reveals weekly sales patterns and identifies high-traffic days (especially Friday and Saturday).
- **Monthly Trend for Total Orders:**  
  Line chart uncovers seasonal/periodic fluctuations and off-peak periods.

#### Sales Distribution Visualizations
- **By Category:**  
  Pie and bar charts show % and volume distribution across Classic, Supreme, Veggie, and Chicken, highlighting best and worst performers.
- **By Size:**  
  Pie chart indicates customer size preferences, critical for inventory and production planning.

#### Best/Worst Seller Analysis
- **Top 5 & Bottom 5:**  
  Visualized by revenue, quantity sold, and order count (bar charts) to identify products that drive sales and ones that are underperforming.

### Why Each Step Was Done

- **KPI Calculation:**  
  To provide quick, at-a-glance performance snapshots for stakeholders.
- **Trend Analysis:**  
  To identify profitable time periods and optimize marketing or inventory efforts.
- **Category/Size Distribution:**
